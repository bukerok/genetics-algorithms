## Execution plan

- [x] Function tree generation
- [x] Tree crossover implementation
- [x] Algorithm implementation
- [x] Refactor code
- [x] Mutation implementation
- [x] Add data printing to the file for visualization
- [x] Resolve issue with EPERM for data writing (resolved using `sync` functions)
- [ ] Update crossover mechanism
- [ ] Write tests for core functionality
- [ ] Refactor code to follow ES code conventions and best practices
- [ ] Rewrite debugging mechanism to work asynchronously
- [ ] Add function constructor by expression
- [ ] Add simplify expression function
- [ ] Add processing for uncontinuous functions
- [ ] Refactor code to create pipeline like workflow
- [ ] Move visualization to separate module
- [ ] Improve visualization interface
- [ ] * Investigate performance issue for trees with depth greater then 10.

### Current lacks

* No processing for incontinuous functions
